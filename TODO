4168 directory api design needs to be refined.
- need to fix outdated tests and write readdir test

3921 bulk bstore get (scan)
- can write pread in terms of scan after 4195

bstore comparison fn:
[x] - parameter to bstore_env_open
[x] - tokufs passes a comparison function which:
        - sorts pathnames by level order (num slashes first, then alpha)
        - not just alpha order (which is depth order)

tests:
- tokufs/bstore truncate needs better tests
and definitions before fixing it correctly
- tokufs mkdir/rmdir/readdir refactor/write
- tokufs stat
- tokufs truncate needs a rewrite
    - unint reads always return 0 now
    - reads always ret num_bytes given (dont stop short)
    - metadata needs to be verified (st.size && st.blocks?)
- stress tests at bstore/tokufs
- stress tests via fuse
    [x] - fsx file system stress test
    covers: random pread, pwrite, truncate, 
            open/close workload in memory.
            verifies contents, lots of
            uninitialized reads.

fuse:
- why does fuse hate us? [x] multithreading
- why does fuse ls -la hate us? [x] passing absolute paths to filler
- why does svn co hang sometimes, in an apparent deadlock?
- need to implement init/destroy to properly handle mount/umount
